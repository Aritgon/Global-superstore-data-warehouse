# Global Superstore Data Warehouse
---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and represents a **Global Superstore's sales data**.
It contains **27** columns covering key domains like **customer information**, **order** and **product details**, **shipping logistics**, and **market locations**.
The data was heavily denormalized, with redundant and repeated fieldsâ€”making it ideal for restructuring into a well-designed data warehouse schema.


## Data Cleaning Summary

- Verified that the dataset had `zero` **null** values.

- Dropped columns that lacked business value or meaningful data.

- Created a `delivery_time` column by subtracting `order_date` from `ship_date`.

- Checked for invalid entries like **quantity < 0** and **delivery_time < 0**.

- Counted transactions with *negative* profit to highlight sales.

- Applied IQR method for outlier detection but chose to **retain outliers** as they can occur in real-world business cases.

- Used `SQLAlchemy` with `to_sql()` to load the cleaned data into a *PostgreSQL* database for further modeling.

## Data warehouse design

- Modeled a star schema with *one* central fact table and *four* supporting dimension tables.

- *fact_superstore* contains transaction-level data including foreign keys to all dimensions to establish relations with other dimension tables.

- *dim_location* captures business-specific geographic information (market, country, state, city) using a composite unique key to maintain business-level granularity. These unique constraints helped to control and validate incoming data from the source system, while data insertion. Used `ON CONFLICT (...) DO UPDATE SET ..` clause alongside `EXCLUDED` keyword to safely update existing records when a conflict occurs, allowing new or corrected data to be inserted without violating constraints.

- *dim_product* uses product_id as a business key sourced directly from the dataset, representing real product identities across the business. To maintain integrity and avoid duplication, the ON CONFLICT (product_id) DO UPDATE SET ... clause is used to update associated fields (like product name, sub-category, and category) whenever a conflict arises. This ensures that if updated product details appear in new records, the existing dimension entry remains up to date without creating duplicates.

To support this, data is inserted using SELECT DISTINCT ON (product_id) rather than a plain SELECT DISTINCT, which plays a crucial role in how duplicates are handled at the product level.
